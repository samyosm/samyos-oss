# Why Internet Wouldn’t Exist Without Open Source?

Since the beginning, open-source software has allowed people and organizations alike to benefit from the wonders of computers. 
While it might not be obvious at first, the internet is the work of millions of developers in all corners of the world. 
Indeed, if it wasn't for the many open-source projects the internet is built upon, you likely wouldn't be reading this.

This article will present you how the open source movement began, 
the difficulties it encountered, 
and how we wouldn't have the technology we now have without it.

## Pre-software

The concept of sharing how to make a technology existed long before computers were invented. 

For example, in the 1900s, a single company owned the rights to the 2-cycle gasoline engine required to make gasoline cars.
Therefore, they were able to monopolize the whole industry while forcing other car manufacturers to adhere to their prices. 

Thankfully, Henry Ford managed to win the patent before making it available to all US auto manufacturers that agreed to a cross licensing agreement. 
It ensured that companies could create patents while making them available to all freely.

After that, the auto industry saw great amounts of innovation to the engine that would of not been possible had the 2-cylce gasoline engine patent not been made available.
