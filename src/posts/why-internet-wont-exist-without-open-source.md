# The Evolution of Open Source: From Sharing Engines to Building the Internet

Since the beginning, open-source software has allowed people and organizations alike to benefit from the wonders of computers. While it might not be obvious at first, the internet is the work of millions of developers in all corners of the world. Indeed, if it wasn't for the many open-source projects the internet is built upon, you likely wouldn't be reading this.

This article will present you how the open source movement began, the difficulties it encountered, and how we wouldn't have the technology we now have without it.

## Pre-software

The concept of sharing how to make a technology existed long before computers were invented.

For example, in the 1900s, a single company owned the rights to the 2-cycle gasoline engine required to make gasoline cars. Therefore, they were able to monopolize the whole industry while forcing other car manufacturers to adhere to their prices.

Thankfully, Henry Ford managed to win the patent before making it available to all US auto manufacturers that agreed to a cross licensing agreement. It ensured that companies could create patents while making them available to all freely.

After that, the auto industry saw great amounts of innovation to the engine that would of not been possible had the 2-cylce gasoline engine patent not been made available.

## The Birth of Open Source in the Computing Era (1950s - 1970s)

The concept of open source in the world of computing can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s when computers were in their infancy. During this time, software and hardware were often bundled together, and access to source code was limited.

However, a significant development occurred in the 1960s with the advent of time-sharing systems like CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). These systems allowed multiple users to access a computer simultaneously, and MIT made the CTSS source code available to other institutions, laying the foundation for collaborative software development.

## The Free Software Movement and the GNU Project (1980s)

The 1980s brought a pivotal moment in the history of open source with the emergence of the Free Software Movement. At the forefront of this movement was Richard Stallman, who founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985. Stallman's philosophy centered around the idea of software freedom, which includes the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software.

Stallman initiated the GNU Project, with the goal of creating a free and open-source Unix-like operating system. Although the GNU Project made significant progress in developing essential software components, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Emacs text editor, a crucial piece of the puzzle was missing: the kernel.

## The Linux Kernel and the Rise of Open Source (1990s)

In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, released the Linux kernel as open-source software. This event marked a significant milestone in the open-source movement, as the kernel is a fundamental part of any operating system. The Linux kernel combined with the GNU software provided a complete, free, and open-source operating system known as GNU/Linux.

The success of Linux attracted developers and organizations worldwide, leading to the formation of a thriving open-source community. Companies like IBM and Red Hat began to support open-source initiatives, recognizing the potential of collaborative software development.

## The Internet Era and Open Source (2000s - 2020s)

As the internet became an integral part of our lives, open source played a crucial role in its development. The World Wide Web itself is built on open standards and protocols, such as HTML, HTTP, and TCP/IP, which were developed collaboratively and made freely available to all.

Open source web servers like Apache and Nginx powered a significant portion of websites, while Linux-based servers provided the backbone of the internet's infrastructure. Content management systems like WordPress and Drupal enabled the creation of dynamic web content, further fueled by open-source databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Moreover, web browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Chromium (the open-source project behind Google Chrome) ensured that users had access to free and open-source software for browsing the web.

## Conclusion

The history of open source spans several decades, from the sharing of engine technology in the early 1900s to the collaborative development of the internet in the 21st century. Open source has not only transformed the software industry but has also laid the foundation for the digital world we inhabit today.

Without open source, the internet as we know it wouldn't exist. The principles of collaboration, transparency, and freedom have driven innovation, empowered individuals and organizations, and shaped the digital landscape. As a long-time developer, you understand that open source is not just a model of software development; it's a fundamental pillar of modern technology, and its influence will continue to shape the future.
