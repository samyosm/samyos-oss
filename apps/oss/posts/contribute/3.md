# How to contribute to an open source project?

Finally, afer forking the repository and cloning it localy, we are ready to
contribute to the project. In this case, you will add your username to a list in
the _README.md_ file.

## Editing

1. Open up the _README.md_ file with a text editor
2. Go to the line after "_## Username List_"
3. Add the following:

```md
- @your-username
```

## Pushing the changes

To see our edits in effect, we have to push them into the main repository.
Before that however, we have to first push them to the forked repository.

1. Open a terminal window at the location of the cloned repository
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added my name"
git push origin main
```

The commands above first add our changes to staged, then create a commit before
pushing them to our forked repository.

If you go back to your forked repository at
www.github.com/your-username/open-source-newcomer, you should see the changes in
effect.

There is one last step covered in the next section: pushing our changes to the
main repository.
