# What is a pull request?

After pushing to our forked repository, we would like the main repository to
pull our changes into it self. To do this, we have to submit a pull request.

1. Go to your forked repository at
   www.github.com/your-username/open-source-newcomer.
2. You should see a button on the top suggesting to open a pull request, press
   it.

3. Press "Create Pull Request"

Now, all you have to do is wait for it to be accepted. Once it has been aproved
and merged, you should see your changes in the official repository.
