# Git Cloning Explained Plainly

In the last section, we learned how to fork a repository. In this section, we
learn about cloning that forked repository localy so that we can work in it.

## What is cloning?

Cloning is to copy the content of a repository to your computer so that you can
make edits.

## How to clone a repository?

To clone a repository, you simply open up a terminal window and enter the
following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY
```

For more information, see
[this guide by Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Practice

To continue from last section, please clone the repository you previously
forked.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-source-newcomer
```

You should now see new directory called '_open-source-newcomer_' in the location
you cloned the repository.
