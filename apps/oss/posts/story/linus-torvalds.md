# The Legend of Linus Torvalds (Linux Creator)

Linus Benedict Torvalds is born on the 28th of December 1969 in Helsinki,
Finland to a educated and wealthy family of journalists. This means he grows up
in tech-savvy environment that sparks his interest in computers. At this point
in time, he has no idea this interest in technology would change the tech world
for ever.

First lines of code in basic:

```basic
10 PRINT "SARA IS THE BEST"
20 GOTO 10
```

## Education

From this interest, he goes to the University of Helsinki for a Master’s degree
in computer science. This allows him to hone his programming skills and teach
him about operating systems. A year after starting university, however, he joins
the Finnish navy for his mandatory military service.

## Linux beginning

At this point, Linus Torvalds started using MS-DOS (Microsoft’s OS) but
preferred using UNIX (IBM’s OS). He was frustrated with their limitations, so he
started working on a new operating system as a small side project. Unbeknownst
to him, this side project would come to power 96.3% of the Internet 20 years
later.

## Linux community

With time, the development of Linux became more than one man can handle. The
project was therefore made open for development by anyone willing to contribute;
that is, it became open source. To Linus’ surprise, a lot of people came to use
and contribute to Linux. Which greatly hastened the release of Linux 1.0.

At the start, Linus was afraid of commercial use of his work so it was actually
forbidden. It is only after hearing a speech by Richard Stallman on the nature
of free and open source software that Linus was moved to use the GPLv2 license.

## Git

The sheer amount of Linux contributions were becoming hard to manage. As such,
Linus created Git, a version control software (VCS). There again, he created
something of immense importance without realizing it.

Git is used by all Fortune 500 companies and almost all software you can think
of. They have over 90% market share of version control software. If you’ve once
worked as a developers, you have most likely used Git.

## Today

By 2006, Linus became much more of a community project rather than Linus’ work.
Indeed, less that 2% of Linus code was was written by Linus himself. Now days,
we can expect the number to be near 0. Still, to this day, he is an active
maintainer of Linux repository and continues to contribute.

## Fun Fact: Beef with Nvidia

In 2012, he participated to a Q&A where people asked him questions about Linux.
Somewhere in the interview, he begins to talk about how hard Nvidia was to work
with; especially with their close-sourced code. However, it quickly got the
point where he says "Nvidia FUCK YOU!" before giving the middle finger.
