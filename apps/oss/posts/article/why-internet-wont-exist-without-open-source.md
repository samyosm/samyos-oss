# The Evolution of Open Source: From Sharing Engines to Building the Internet

Since the beginning, open-source software has allowed people and organizations
alike to benefit from the wonders of computers. While it might not be obvious at
first, the internet is the work of millions of developers in all corners of the
world. Indeed, if it wasn't for the many open-source projects the internet is
built upon, you likely wouldn't be reading this.

This article will present you how the open source movement began, the
difficulties it encountered, and how we wouldn't have the technology we now have
without it.

## Pre-software

The concept of sharing how to make a technology existed long before computers
were invented.

For example, in the 1900s, a single company owned the rights to the 2-cycle
gasoline engine required to make gasoline cars. Therefore, they were able to
monopolize the whole industry while forcing other car manufacturers to adhere to
their prices.

Thankfully, Henry Ford managed to win the patent before making it available to
all US auto manufacturers that agreed to a cross licensing agreement. It ensured
that companies could create patents while making them available to all freely.

After that, the auto industry saw great amounts of innovation to the engine that
would of not been possible had the 2-cylce gasoline engine patent not been made
available.

## The Birth of Open Source in the Computing Era (1950s - 1970s)

The concept of open source in the world of computing can be traced back to the
1950s and 1960s when computers were in their infancy. During this time, software
and hardware were often bundled together, and access to source code was limited.

However, a significant development occurred in the 1960s with the advent of
time-sharing systems like CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). These systems allowed multiple
users to access a computer simultaneously, and MIT made the CTSS source code
available to other institutions, laying the foundation for collaborative
software development.

## The Free Software Movement and the GNU Project (1980s)

The 1980s brought a pivotal moment in the history of open source with the
emergence of the Free Software Movement. At the forefront of this movement was
Richard Stallman, who founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985.
Stallman's philosophy centered around the idea of software freedom, which
includes the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software.

Stallman initiated the GNU Project, with the goal of creating a free and
open-source Unix-like operating system. Although the GNU Project made
significant progress in developing essential software components, such as the
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Emacs text editor, a crucial piece of
the puzzle was missing: the kernel.

## The Linux Kernel and the Rise of Open Source (1990s)

In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, released the Linux
kernel as open-source software. This event marked a significant milestone in the
open-source movement, as the kernel is a fundamental part of any operating
system. The Linux kernel combined with the GNU software provided a complete,
free, and open-source operating system known as GNU/Linux.

The success of Linux attracted developers and organizations worldwide, leading
to the formation of a thriving open-source community. Companies like IBM and Red
Hat began to support open-source initiatives, recognizing the potential of
collaborative software development.

## The Internet Era and Open Source (2000s - 2020s)

As the internet became an integral part of our lives, open source played a
crucial role in its development. The World Wide Web itself is built on open
standards and protocols, such as HTML, HTTP, and TCP/IP, which were developed
collaboratively and made freely available to all.

Open source web servers like Apache and Nginx powered a significant portion of
websites, while Linux-based servers provided the backbone of the internet's
infrastructure. Content management systems like WordPress and Drupal enabled the
creation of dynamic web content, further fueled by open-source databases like
MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Moreover, web browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Chromium (the open-source
project behind Google Chrome) ensured that users had access to free and
open-source software for browsing the web.

## Conclusion

The history of open source spans several decades, from the sharing of engine
technology in the early 1900s to the collaborative development of the internet
in the 21st century. Open source has not only transformed the software industry
but has also laid the foundation for the digital world we inhabit today.

Without open source, the internet as we know it wouldn't exist. The principles
of collaboration, transparency, and freedom have driven innovation, empowered
individuals and organizations, and shaped the digital landscape. As a long-time
developer, you understand that open source is not just a model of software
development; it's a fundamental pillar of modern technology, and its influence
will continue to shape the future.
